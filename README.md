# first-angular-firebase

Simple address book like app only uses create, not a full CRUD app.

Extremely easy 3-way-data-binding! To get full wow factor try opening multiple sessions at once and add 'employees.' All session will update in realtime! App is usable offline and will update db with offline added data once connection is restored, WOW!
